        Mental Health

    </h1>
    <br />
    <p style="font-size:20px">
        a person’s mental health affects how they feel, think, behave and relate to others. mental illness covers a spectrum of disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behaviours. examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviours.
        many people have mental health concerns from time to time. but a mental health concern becomes a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function.
        a mental illness can make you miserable and can cause problems in your daily life. in most cases, symptoms can be managed with a combination of medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy).
