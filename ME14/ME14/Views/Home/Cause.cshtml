<h1>Cause</h1>
<p>
    Mental illnesses, in general, are thought to be caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors:<br />
    • <strong>Inherited traits</strong>. Mental illness is more common in people whose blood relatives also have a mental illness. Certain genes may increase your risk of developing a mental illness, and your life situation may trigger it.
    <br />•<strong>Environmental exposures before birth</strong>. Exposure to environmental stressors, inflammatory conditions, toxins, alcohol or drugs while in the womb can sometimes be linked to mental illness.
    <br />• <strong>Brain chemistry</strong>. Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that carry signals to other parts of your brain and body. When the neural networks involving these chemicals are impaired, the function of nerve receptors and nerve systems change, leading to depression and other emotional disorders.
