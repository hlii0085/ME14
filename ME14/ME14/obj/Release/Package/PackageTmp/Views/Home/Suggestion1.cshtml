<h3>1.Stay connected</h3>
<h4>Not knowing English may make you feel disconnected with Australian society but try to stay connected with your family and friends. Spending time together and talking to them will reduce your risk of having mental health issues.</h4>

<h3>3.Learn one new word everyday</h3>
<h4>To avoid any mental health issue in future too, try to connect with Australian community by learning our language. Learn one word every day and try to use it at least 5 times a day and 17 times a week to remember it for future use.</h4>
