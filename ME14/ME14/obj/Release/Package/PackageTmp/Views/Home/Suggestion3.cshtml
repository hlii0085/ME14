<h3>6.Get close to nature</h3>

<br />
<h3>7.Be present in the moment</h3>
<h4>Stop your heart and brain from racing by just pausing everything in the moment and sitting to acknowledge the present time. Close your eyes and feel the surface your body is touching. Listen to all the noise around you and tell yourself that this is the present and that your brain should not wander around</h4>
