    <h1 style="color:darkred">About Mental Health</h1>
    <p>
        A person’s mental health affects how they feel, think, behave and relate to others. Mental illness covers a spectrum of disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behaviours. Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviours.
        Many people have mental health concerns from time to time. But a mental health concern becomes a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function.
        A mental illness can make you miserable and can cause problems in your daily life. In most cases, symptoms can be managed with a combination of medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy).

    <h1 style="color:darkred">Causes</h1>
    <p>
        Mental illnesses, in general, are thought to be caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors:<br />
        • Inherited traits. Mental illness is more common in people whose blood relatives also have a mental illness. Certain genes may increase your risk of developing a mental illness, and your life situation may trigger it.
        <br />• Environmental exposures before birth. Exposure to environmental stressors, inflammatory conditions, toxins, alcohol or drugs while in the womb can sometimes be linked to mental illness.
        <br />• Brain chemistry. Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that carry signals to other parts of your brain and body. When the neural networks involving these chemicals are impaired, the function of nerve receptors and nerve systems change, leading to depression and other emotional disorders.
    </p>

    <h1 style="color:darkred">Risk factors</h1>
    <p>
        Certain factors may increase your risk of developing a mental illness, including:
        <br />• A history of mental illness in a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling
        <br />• Stressful life situations, such as financial problems, a loved one's death or a divorce
        <br />• An ongoing (chronic) medical condition, such as diabetes
        <br />• Brain damage as a result of a serious injury (traumatic brain injury), such as a violent blow to the head
        <br />• Traumatic experiences, such as military combat or assault
        <br />• Use of alcohol or recreational drugs
        <br />• A childhood history of abuse or neglect
        <br />• Few friends or few healthy relationships
        <br />• A previous mental illness
    </p>

    <h1 style="color:darkred">Prevention</h1>
    <p>
        There's no sure way to prevent mental illness. However, if you have a mental illness, taking steps to control stress, to increase your resilience and to boost low self-esteem may help keep your symptoms under control. Follow these steps:
        <br />• Pay attention to warning signs. Work with your doctor or therapist to learn what might trigger your symptoms. Make a plan so that you know what to do if symptoms return. Contact your doctor or therapist if you notice any changes in symptoms or how you feel. Consider involving family members or friends to watch for warning signs.
        <br />• Get routine medical care. Don't neglect checkups or skip visits to your primary care provider, especially if you aren't feeling well. You may have a new health problem that needs to be treated, or you may be experiencing side effects of medication.
        <br />• Get help when you need it. Mental health conditions can be harder to treat if you wait until symptoms get bad. Long-term maintenance treatment also may help prevent a relapse of symptoms.
        <br />• Take good care of yourself. Sufficient sleep, healthy eating and regular physical activity are important. Try to maintain a regular schedule. Talk to your primary care provider if you have trouble sleeping or if you have questions about diet and physical activity.
    </p>

    <h1 style="color:darkred">When to see a doctor</h1>
    <p>If you have any signs or symptoms of a mental illness, see your primary care provider or a mental health professional. Most mental illnesses don't improve on their own, and if untreated, a mental illness may get worse over time and cause serious problems.</p>
